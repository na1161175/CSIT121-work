            <p>I was initially confused about the placement of the main
            , article, header, and body elements for this webpage,
         but then I followed the wireframe of the assignment and eventually 
            figured out where to put each.  </p>

                <li>Structuring Text</li>

            <p>Learning about HTML elements is very important as it sets the base. The websites that helped me the most were:</p>

            <h2 class="center">Lab 3: CSS Basics </h2>
            <p id="alert"> Working on Lab 03 was fun, but it was time-consuming
                because we had to manually insert the 
                fonts and colors, unlike office apps, 
                where we can change them with a click.
                However, I understand that HTML and
                 Microsoft Office are different and 
                 require different workflows.

            <h2 class="center">Lab 5: Layout Lab </h2>  
            <p>Responsive web design is all about making sure that the content is displayed well, 
                regardless of the device used. It is recommended to start with mobile design because if it 
                works on a small screen, it will be easier to expand it to larger screens. The main thing 
                is to focus on making flexible layouts that adapt. We can achieve this by using media 
                queries, which adjust column layouts, font sizes, and image sizes based on screen width. 
                Also, it is important to keep buttons big enough to tap easily on touch screens so that 
                people don't accidentally tap the wrong thing. For example, when navigating on phones, 
                we want links stacked vertically so they're easy to tap. However, on desktops, there is 
                enough space to spread them out horizontally. Additionally, it is essential to keep designs
                simple and clean to help users process information more easily and avoid burdening pages 
                with lots of text. It is also recommended to pair visuals with text, maintain visual
                consistency and to develop a clear visual hierarchy.  </p>
            <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Creating a navigation menu at the top of the page that links to each blog post.
                <li>Implementing a mobile-friendly single-column layout using CSS flexbox.</li>
                <li>Creating a multi-column layout for desktop screens using media queries.</li>
            </ol>
