        <h1> UI/UX Evaluation</h1>
        <h2 class="highlight">Information About the Website</h2>
        <img src="Screenshot_2025-10-30_120639.png" width="700" height="500" alt="Screenshot of the United States Botanic Garden website homepage">
        <h2>URL of the Website</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.usbg.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.usbg.gov/</a></p>
        <h2>Name of the Website</h2>
        <p>United States Botanic Garden</p>
        <h2>Site's Target Audience</h2>
        <p>The site's target audience is tourists; people who just want to see pretty plants and have a nice day out. It is also
            for plant lovers, scientists, teachers, and conservationists who deeply care about plant research and protecting plant 
            species. The website gives basic information like hours and directions for tourists, but it also has detailed sections 
            about conservation projects and educational programs for people who want to learn more and get involved in important 
            plant work. Overall, this site inspires people to conserve, study and appreciate plants.</p>
        <h2 class="highlight">Evaluation of the Website</h2>
        <h2>Site Organization</h2>
        <p>This website has hierarchical organization as it has a clearly defined home page and contains
            navigation links to major site sections.</p>
        <h2>CRAP Design Principle</h2> 
        <p>This website uses the principle of proximity as all the related information on the website is grouped. For example, the three 
            locations are in one block, and the footer section groups related navigation items such as Visit, Learn, Gardens & Plants, etc.
            Also, all the social media links are written together. This makes it easy for users to find information and understand quickly
            how information is organized. It also uses alignment, as nothing on the website is placed randomly. Every item on the page has
            a visual connection with something else on the page. Related information is grouped.</p>
        <h2>Audit Score</h2> 
        <p>The website's audit score is 59% and it has 28 critical issues.</p>
        <h2>Site's Effectiveness</h2>
        <p>I think this site is effective as it allows users to complete actions accurately. It has a clear organization, which makes it easy for 
        users to find what they need. Also, it provides multiple ways to access the rest of the content, such as through the navigation 
        menu, and includes links in the footer.</p> 
        <h2>Site's Efficiency</h2> 
        <p>This site has a clear hierarchical structure and supports quick navigation. Links are provided in the footer as well, and this makes it easier to access all major sections. Hours and location information are 
        on the homepage, so users don't have to find them, and social media links are also repeated for easy access. Also, it appears to 
        follow the 3-click rule for most content.</p>
        <h2>Site's Engagement</h2>
        <p>The site's engagement is pleasant and is appropriate for a government institution's website for a botanical garden. The site is informative,
         organized, and welcoming. It emphasizes the beauty and discovery of plants and has educational programs and virtual tours available.</p>
        <h2>Recommendation to Improve this Website</h2>
        <p>One thing I would recommend improving in this website is to limit options on the homepage and only display important information. So that it is easier for users to complete tasks, 
        and include 3 prominent buttons on the homepage for the most common user tasks, 
        like Plan Your Visit, and include all hours, locations, directions, and accessibility. Also, include What to See and Learn, and Engage.</p>
