                <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
                <p>Completing the final project was indeed lengthy and difficult, as I had to go back and edit all my labs to make one cohesive website, which included the requirements of having a clear content hierarchy through the use of headings,  consistent and accessible navigation, all structural elements, the whole website designed with one CSS-styled page, and including a special mobile layout. Despite it being challenging, it was rewarding to see the outcome as my whole semester’s work is now compiled in a single website. Now that I think, this project would have been much easier to do if I had used the same colors and styles when I started building my websites, but it is also part of the growth to change the design structures, too.</p>
                <p>I learnt a lot in this course. When I started, I did not know anything about website designing, let alone HTML. However, now I have knowledge about HTML structure, CSS styling, accessibility practices, and user experience design. We learnt HTML, ARIA attributes, responsive design with media queries, and web standards like XML and Touch Events in this class. I think the hands-on lab approach helped me a lot as I am a practical learner, and I like how each assignment was built upon previous skills in a meaningful way. I'm proud of how far I have come. Moving forward, I plan to continue building on these skills and exploring JavaScript frameworks to create even more interactive web experiences.</p>
