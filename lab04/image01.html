            <p>This is such a cute picture of three puppies in a basket. It is a JPEG file type.
                JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group. It is a widely used format for digital photographs due to 
                its efficient compression method, which significantly reduces file size while maintaining reasonable image quality.
                JPEG files support up to 16.7 million colors, making them suitable for detailed photographs. 
                They use lossy compression, where unnecessary data is removed to create smaller file sizes, though some image quality may be lost in the process.
                I selected this image because I love puppies and this is an appealing portrait of them. 
                Additionally, it is fortunate that the image is available under a Creative Commons license.</p><br>
