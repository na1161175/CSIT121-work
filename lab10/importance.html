        <h1>Importance</h1>
        <p>
          Touch events are very important as they enable direct interaction on touch screens, managing gestures 
          like swipes, multi-finger interactions, and long-presses, all promoting a richer user interface experience
          in tablets and smartphones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because most people now use touch devices like phones and tablets, websites must react well to touch just 
          as web applications do. Mouse events don't work well for touch screens, as they can't support multiple 
          finger touches at once. They also have some technical limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike mouse events (designed for desktops), touch events allow for multiple simultaneous touches on
          different parts of the screen, which is critical to modern mobile experiences. Using touch events, 
          developers can create applications that will be natural to users on touch screens, without forcing them 
          to interact with mouse clicks.
