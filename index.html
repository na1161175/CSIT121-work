        <h1>Learning Web Standards</h1>
        <h2>Labs 1 & 2: HTML Basics</h2>
     <main>
        <article>
            <p>I was initially confused about the placement of the main
            , article, header, and body elements for this webpage,
         but then I followed the wireframe of the assignment and eventually 
            figured out where to put each.  </p>
            <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>HTML Basics</li>
                <li>Structuring Text</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Learning about HTML elements is very important as it sets the base. The wesites that helped me the most were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp"> W3Schools</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">Web Docs</a></li>

            </ul>
            <h2 class="center">Lab 3 </h2>
            <p>I was initially confused about the placement of the main
            , article, header, and body elements for this webpage,
         but then I followed the wireframe of the assignment and eventually 
            figured out where to put each.  </p>
            <p id="alert"> Working on Lab 03 was fun, but it was time-consuming
                because we had to manually insert the 
                fonts and colors, unlike office apps, 
                where we can change them with a click.
                However, I understand that HTML and
                 Microsoft Office are different and 
                 require different workflows.

            <p>The websites that I found the most helpful while working on this assignment were:</p>
